# Vagrant Disks

Vagrant Disks is a feature that allows users to define what mediums should be attached
to their guests, as well as allowing users to resize their primary disk.

For examples on how to achieve this, among other use cases, please refer to the [usage](/vagrant/docs/disks/usage)
guide for more information!

For more information about what options are available for configuring disks, see the
[configuration section](/vagrant/docs/disks/configuration).

## Supported Providers

Currently, only VirtualBox is supported. Please refer to the [VirtualBox documentation](/vagrant/docs/disks/virtualbox) for more information on using disks with the VirtualBox provider!
