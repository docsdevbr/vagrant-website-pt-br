# Usage

The Vagrant VirtualBox provider is used just like any other provider. Please
read the general [basic usage](/vagrant/docs/providers/basic_usage) page for
providers.

The value to use for the `--provider` flag is `virtualbox`.

The Vagrant VirtualBox provider does not support parallel execution at this
time. Specifying the `--parallel` option will have no effect.
